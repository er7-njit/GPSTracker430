**Unit Tracker Tag**

Hardware:

* GSM PPS Hat Tracker (to find the data)  
* Processor \- ATmega328P (On the arduino)  
* Power management  
  * Coin Battery  
  * LiPo Battery  
* Enclosure  
  * 3D print case  
* Each device will have their own SIM card  
  * From IOT network provider  
* Water Proofing  
* Size  
  * Goal to make smaller than a credit card  
* Bluetooth

Printed Circuit Board:  
Input: 

* GPS  
* Power  
  Output:   
* LTE Network  
* Web GUI   
  * Nextcloud PhoneTrack   
* ICLOUD (Probably not because licensing)  
* Display (Probably not because of battery concerns)

Review Project Def and Design Document:  
• What will require additional research?  
We would need to do additional research on the following:

* Better predict the conditions of hardware to design a good way to weatherproof  
* How to set up and program WEB GUI and GPS Hat   
* Understand how the parts are compatible with each other


• What needs to be completed before something else can be started?

* We need to iron out how all the components will work together before ordering any components.

• What feels unclear or not obvious?

* Programming the microcontroller and integrating it with the other components  
* Having the GPS/GSM Hat integrate with our webGUI  
* Power management
